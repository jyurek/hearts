# Hearts in elm

Purely a testing ground, so don't take this shit seriously.

* `make` - builds everything in `src` into `hearts.js` which is included in
  `index.html`.
* `make open` - makes `all` and then opens `index.html` with `open`
* `make clean` - removes all the build artifacts, like `hearts.js` and most
  things from `styles/`.

Yeah, this uses `make`. Oldschool, right?
